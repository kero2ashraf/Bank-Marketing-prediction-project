# Bank-Marketing-prediction-project

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

python packages :

1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplolb.pyplot
4) seaborn
5) ydata_profiling
6) matplolib.ticker import FormatStrFormatter
7) from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler,StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder
8) from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV,KFold,cross_val_score
9) from sklearn.metrics import classification_report,confusion_matrix
10) from sklearn.svm import SVC
11) import sklearn.metrics as sk
12) from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
13) from sklearn import tree
